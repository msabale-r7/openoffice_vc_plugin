          operation that could trigger execution of unwanted software 
          installed by a Trojan Horse application.  The installer defect
          is known as an "unquoted Windows search path vulnerability." In the case of Apache OpenOffice installers for Windows, the PC
          must have previously been infected by a Trojan Horse application
          (or user) running with administrative privilege.  Any installer
          with the unquoted search path vulnerability becomes a delayed
          trigger for the exploit.  The exploit may already have operated
          on the user's PC. Severity: Medium There are no known exploits of this vulnerabilty.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected. Mitigation Install Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 for the latest maintenance and
          cumulative security fixes.  Use the Apache OpenOfficedownload page.If instead of a typical installation you use a custom-installation
          option to change the location where Apache OpenOffice is installed,
          use a location that has no spaces in its full-path name. Defenses and Work-Arounds If you are unable to update to 4.1.3, there are other precautions
          that can be taken.  These precausions are also recommended as protection against other software that may have the vulnerability.Ensure that there are no programs installed at the top-level folder
          (usually C:\) where Windows is installed.  All are dangerous,
          especially ones named "Program", whether "Program.exe" or some
          other variation.If such programs are found, install or update to current
          anti-virus/-malware software.  Perform a complete system scan.
          The scan may provide for removal of programs where there should
          not be any.  If that does not happen, it is necessary to remove
          any Program.exe and others manually using administrator privilege. Further Information For additional information and assistance, consult theApache OpenOffice 
          Community Forums, or make requests to theusers@openoffice.apache.orgpublic mailing list. Defects not involving suspected security 
          vulnerabilities can be reported with a normal issue viaBugzilla. The latest information on Apache OpenOffice security bulletins can
