     43 bits making the stored passwords vulnerable to a brute force attack if an attacker has access to the
     users stored config. Severity: Moderate There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Thanks to the reporter for discovering this issue. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.12 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions may also be affected.
