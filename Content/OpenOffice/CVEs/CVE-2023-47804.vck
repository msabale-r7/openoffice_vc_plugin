     arguments. Several URI Schemes are defined for this purpose. Links can be activated by
     clicks, or by automatic document events. The execution of such links must be subject to
     user approval. In the affected versions of Apache OpenOffice, approval for certain links
     is not requested; when activated, such links could therefore result in arbitrary script
     execution. This is a corner case of2022-47502. Severity: Moderate There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists.
