There are no predictable symptoms that would indicate this issue has occurred. To workaround the described issue, make sure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not empty before running soffice or other OpenOffice.org shell scripts. This issue is addressed in the following release:OpenOffice.org 3.3 OpenOffice.org acknowledges with thanks, Dmitri Gribenko.
