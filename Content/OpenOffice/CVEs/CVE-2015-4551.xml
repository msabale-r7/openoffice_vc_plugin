        TARGETED DATA DISCLOSURE Fixed in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 Version 1.0Announced November 4, 2015 A vulnerability in OpenOffice settings of OpenDocument Format
        files and templates allows silent access to files that are
        readable from an user account, over-riding the user's default
        configuration settings.  Once these files are imported into a
        maliciously-crafted document, the data can be silently hidden
        in the document and possibly exported to an external party
        without being observed. Severity: Important There are no known exploits of this vulnerabilty.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.1 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected. Related:CVE-2014-3575andCVE-2012-0037 Mitigation Apache OpenOffice users are urged to download and install
        Apache OpenOffice version 4.1.2 or later. Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 mitigates this vulnerability by ignoring
        in-document settings that over-ride default behavior when accessing
        data beyond the document itself.  The automatic default behavior
        is changed to make such access evident to the user, who must then
        approve the access. Nature of Attack This vulnerability requires an exquisitely crafted attack to
        locate targeted files, silently retrieve them, and then deliver
        their data in a manner that escapes notice.  Knowledge of the
        user's system and specific configuration is generally required. Precautions  In addition to keeping Apache OpenOffice updated, users can reduce
        the threat of this kind of data access from ODF
        documents.  Keep documents and sensitive materials separate from
        common, predictable locations, including on networks.  Require
        additional access permissions for access to sensitive materials
        even when operating under the user's normal account.
