<VULNERABILITY><ID>CVE-2012-2665</ID><PRODUCT>OpenOffice</PRODUCT><AFFECTED_VERSION>Fixed in Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1</AFFECTED_VERSION><DESCRIPTION>Description: When OpenOffice reads an ODF document, it first loads and 
    processes an XML stream within the file called the manifest.  Apache 
    OpenOffice 3.4.0 has logic errors that allows a carefully crafted manifest 
    to cause reads and writes beyond allocated buffers. No specific exploit has been demonstrated 
    in this case, though such flaws generally are conducive to exploitation, 
    possibly including denial of service and elevation of privilege. OpenOffice users are advised toupgrade to Apache OpenOffice 
3.4.1. Users who are unable 
to upgrade immediately should exercise caution when opening untrusted ODF 
documents. The Apache OpenOffice Security Team acknowledges Timo Warns of PRESENSE 
    Technologies GmbH as the discoverer of these flaws. Security Home-&gt;Bulletin-&gt;CVE-2012-2665</DESCRIPTION><REFERENCE>https://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2012-2665.html</REFERENCE></VULNERABILITY>
