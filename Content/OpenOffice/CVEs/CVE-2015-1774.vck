        malicious documents that cause denial of service (memory
        corruption and application crash) and possible execution of arbitrary
        code. Severity: Important Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions AffectedAll Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.1 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected. Mitigation Update to Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 or a later version. This mitigation drops Apache OpenOffice support for documents
        created in "Hangul Word Processor" format.  The filter is not
        installed; it will not be used if present. Workarounds and Document Migration Users of older HWP-format documents that are already trusted should
        convert those documents to other formats before removing the filter
        or upgrading to Apache OpenOffice version 4.1.2. Apache OpenOffice users who do not upgrade can remove the
        problematic filter themselves.  The filter is in the "program"
        folder of their OpenOffice installation.  OnWindowsthe filter is named "hwp.dll", onMac OS Xit is named
        "libhwp.dylib" and onLinuxit is named "libhwp.so".
        Alternatively the filter can be renamed to anything else (e.g.
        "hwp_renamed.dll") to disable its use.
