              Elevated Privileges Version 1.0 Announced October 11, 2016 Description The Apache OpenOffice installer for Winodws contained a defective
          operation that allows execution of arbitrary code with elevated
          privileges. The location in which the installer is run may have been 
            previously poisoned by a file that impersonates a dynamic-link
            library that the installer depends upon.  The counterfeit is
            operated instead because of a search path defect in the 
            installer.  The counterfeit will be operated under the
            administrative privileges of the OpenOffice installer,
            compromising the users's PC. Severity: Medium There are no known exploits of this vulnerabilty.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected. Mitigation Install Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 for the latest maintenance and
          cumulative security fixes.  Use the Apache OpenOfficedownload page. Defenses and Work-Arounds If you are unable to update to 4.1.3, there are other precautions
          that can be taken.  These precausions are also recommended as protection against other software that may have the vulnerability.When executing .exe installers, ensure that the installer is in a file folder that has no other files but the installer .exe file.If an installer proposes a folder to extract the setup files
          into before the actual install, choose the name of a folder that is not in use.  Delete such a folder of setup files after the installation completes successfully.  To reinstall without 
          downloading again, preserve the installer .exe on private 
          removable storage. Further Information For additional information and assistance, consult theApache OpenOffice
