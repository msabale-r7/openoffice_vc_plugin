     weakens the security of the encryption making them vulnerable if an attacker has access to the user's
     configuration data. Severity: Moderate There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Thanks to the reporter for discovering this issue. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.12 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions may also be affected. Mitigation Install Apache OpenOffice 4.1.13 for the latest maintenance and cumulative security fixes.
