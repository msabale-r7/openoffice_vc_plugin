<VULNERABILITY><ID>CVE-2016-1513</ID><PRODUCT>OpenOffice</PRODUCT><AFFECTED_VERSION>Fixed in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3</AFFECTED_VERSION><DESCRIPTION>CVE-2016-1513 Apache OpenOffice Advisory Memory Corruption Vulnerability (Impress Presentations) Version 3.0 Updated October 11, 2016Updated August 30, 2016Announced July 21, 2016 Description An OpenDocument Presentation .ODP or Presentation Template .OTP file
          can contain invalid presentation elements that lead to memory
          corruption when the document is loaded in Apache OpenOffice Impress.
          The defect may cause the document to appear as corrupted and
          OpenOffice may crash in a recovery-stuck mode requiring manual
          intervention. A crafted exploitation of the defect can allow an
          attacker to cause denial of service (memory corruption and
          application crash) and possible execution of arbitrary code. Impress cannot be used to directly produce documents having the
           CVE-2016-1513-related defect.  Impress-authored .ODF and .ODT
          documents of an user's own that exhibit any of these characteristics
          are not the result of an exploit.  They may be consequences
          of a separate Impress defect that should be reported. Severity: Medium There are no known exploits of this vulnerabilty.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected. Mitigation Install Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 for the latest maintenance and
          cumulative security fixes.  Use the Apache OpenOfficedownload pageUsers of Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 that cannot update to 4.1.3
          can Install the 4.1.2-patch1 Hotfix available athttp://archive.apache.org/dist/openoffice/4.1.2-patch1/hotfix.html.A source-code patch that blocks the vulnerability has been developed and is available for developers atissue 127045with SVN revision1754535.Antivirus products can detect documents attempting to exploit this vulnerability by employing Snort Signature IDs 35828-35829. Defenses and Work-Arounds If you are unable to update, there are other precautions that
          can be taken.  These precausions are recommended for all users
          of all versions of Apache OpenOffice, including the latest
          available.Avoid operating Apache OpenOffice (and any other personal
          productivity programs) under a computer account that has 
          administrative privileges of any kind. While installation of 
          Apache OpenOffice requires elevated privileges and user permission 
          on platforms such as Microsoft Windows, operation of the software 
          does not.Keeping antivirus/antimalware software current is also important. 
          This will serve to identify and distinguish suspicious documents 
          that involve the exploit, avoiding confusion with documents that 
          are damaged and/or fail for other reasons. Further Information For additional information and assistance, consult theApache OpenOffice 
          Community Forums, or make requests to theusers@openoffice.apache.orgpublic mailing list. Defects not involving suspected security 
          vulnerabilities can be reported with a normal issue viaBugzilla. The latest information on Apache OpenOffice security bulletins can 
          be found at theBulletin Archive page. Credits The Apache OpenOffice project acknowledges the discovery and analysis for CVE-2016-1513 by Yves Younan and Richard Johnson of Cisco Talos.
