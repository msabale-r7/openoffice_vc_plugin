        Arbitrary file disclosure in Calc and Writer Fixed in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.4 Description By exploiting the way OpenOffice renders embedded objects, an attacker could craft a document
           that allows reading in a file from the user's filesystem. Information could be retrieved by the
           attacker by, e.g., using hidden sections to store the information, tricking the user into
           saving the document and convincing the user to sent the document back to the attacker. The vulnerability is mitigated by the need for the attacker to know the precise file path
           in the target system, and the need to trick the user into saving the document and sending it
           back. Severity: Medium There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Thanks to Ben Hayak for reporting this issue. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.3 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected.
