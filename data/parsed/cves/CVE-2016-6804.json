  "description": "CVE-2016-6804 Apache OpenOffice Advisory Windows Installer Execution of Arbitrary Code with \n              Elevated Privileges Version 1.0 Announced October 11, 2016 Description The Apache OpenOffice installer for Winodws contained a defective\n          operation that allows execution of arbitrary code with elevated\n          privileges. The location in which the installer is run may have been \n            previously poisoned by a file that impersonates a dynamic-link\n            library that the installer depends upon.  The counterfeit is\n            operated instead because of a search path defect in the \n            installer.  The counterfeit will be operated under the\n            administrative privileges of the OpenOffice installer,\n            compromising the users's PC. Severity: Medium There are no known exploits of this vulnerabilty.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected. Mitigation Install Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 for the latest maintenance and\n          cumulative security fixes.  Use the Apache OpenOfficedownload page. Defenses and Work-Arounds If you are unable to update to 4.1.3, there are other precautions\n          that can be taken.  These precausions are also recommended as protection against other software that may have the vulnerability.When executing .exe installers, ensure that the installer is in a file folder that has no other files but the installer .exe file.If an installer proposes a folder to extract the setup files\n          into before the actual install, choose the name of a folder that is not in use.  Delete such a folder of setup files after the installation completes successfully.  To reinstall without \n          downloading again, preserve the installer .exe on private \n          removable storage.
