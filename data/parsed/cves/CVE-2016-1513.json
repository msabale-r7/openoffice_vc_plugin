  "description": "CVE-2016-1513 Apache OpenOffice Advisory Memory Corruption Vulnerability (Impress Presentations) Version 3.0 Updated October 11, 2016Updated August 30, 2016Announced July 21, 2016 Description An OpenDocument Presentation .ODP or Presentation Template .OTP file\n          can contain invalid presentation elements that lead to memory\n          corruption when the document is loaded in Apache OpenOffice Impress.\n          The defect may cause the document to appear as corrupted and\n          OpenOffice may crash in a recovery-stuck mode requiring manual\n          intervention. A crafted exploitation of the defect can allow an\n          attacker to cause denial of service (memory corruption and\n          application crash) and possible execution of arbitrary code. Impress cannot be used to directly produce documents having the\n           CVE-2016-1513-related defect.  Impress-authored .ODF and .ODT\n          documents of an user's own that exhibit any of these characteristics\n          are not the result of an exploit.  They may be consequences\n          of a separate Impress defect that should be reported. Severity: Medium There are no known exploits of this vulnerabilty.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected. Mitigation Install Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 for the latest maintenance and\n          cumulative security fixes.  Use the Apache OpenOfficedownload pageUsers of Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 that cannot update to 4.1.3\n          can Install the 4.1.2-patch1 Hotfix available athttp://archive.apache.org/dist/openoffice/4.1.2-patch1/hotfix.html.A source-code patch that blocks the vulnerability has been developed and is available for developers atissue 127045with SVN revision1754535.Antivirus products can detect documents attempting to exploit this vulnerability by employing Snort Signature IDs 35828-35829. Defenses and Work-Arounds If you are unable to update, there are other precautions that\n          can be taken.  These precausions are recommended for all users\n          of all versions of Apache OpenOffice, including the latest\n          available.Avoid operating Apache OpenOffice (and any other personal\n          productivity programs) under a computer account that has \n          administrative privileges of any kind. While installation of \n          Apache OpenOffice requires elevated privileges and user permission \n          on platforms such as Microsoft Windows, operation of the software \n          does not.Keeping antivirus/antimalware software current is also important. \n          This will serve to identify and distinguish suspicious documents \n          that involve the exploit, avoiding confusion with documents that \n          are damaged and/or fail for other reasons.

Defects not involving suspected security \n          vulnerabilities can be reported with a normal issue viaBugzilla.
