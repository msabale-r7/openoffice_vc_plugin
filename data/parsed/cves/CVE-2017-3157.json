  "description": "CVE-2017-3157 Apache OpenOffice Advisory CVE-2017-3157:\n        Arbitrary file disclosure in Calc and Writer Fixed in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.4 Description By exploiting the way OpenOffice renders embedded objects, an attacker could craft a document\n           that allows reading in a file from the user's filesystem. Information could be retrieved by the\n           attacker by, e.g., using hidden sections to store the information, tricking the user into\n           saving the document and convincing the user to sent the document back to the attacker. The vulnerability is mitigated by the need for the attacker to know the precise file path\n           in the target system, and the need to trick the user into saving the document and sending it\n           back. Severity: Medium There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Thanks to Ben Hayak for reporting this issue. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.3 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected.
