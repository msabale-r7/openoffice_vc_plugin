  "cve_id": "CVE-2012-2665",
  "affected_version": "Fixed in Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1",
  "description": "Description: When OpenOffice reads an ODF document, it first loads and \n    processes an XML stream within the file called the manifest.  Apache \n    OpenOffice 3.4.0 has logic errors that allows a carefully crafted manifest \n    to cause reads and writes beyond allocated buffers. No specific exploit has been demonstrated \n    in this case, though such flaws generally are conducive to exploitation, \n    possibly including denial of service and elevation of privilege. OpenOffice users are advised toupgrade to Apache OpenOffice \n3.4.1. Users who are unable \nto upgrade immediately should exercise caution when opening untrusted ODF \ndocuments. The Apache OpenOffice Security Team acknowledges Timo Warns of PRESENSE \n    Technologies GmbH as the discoverer of these flaws. Security Home->Bulletin->CVE-2012-2665",
