  "description": "CVE-2016-6803 Apache OpenOffice Advisory Windows Installer Can Enable Privileged Trojan Execution Version 1.0 Announced October 11, 2016 Description The Apache OpenOffice installer for Winodws contained a defective\n          operation that could trigger execution of unwanted software \n          installed by a Trojan Horse application.  The installer defect\n          is known as an \"unquoted Windows search path vulnerability.\" In the case of Apache OpenOffice installers for Windows, the PC\n          must have previously been infected by a Trojan Horse application\n          (or user) running with administrative privilege.  Any installer\n          with the unquoted search path vulnerability becomes a delayed\n          trigger for the exploit.  The exploit may already have operated\n          on the user's PC. Severity: Medium There are no known exploits of this vulnerabilty.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected. Mitigation Install Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 for the latest maintenance and\n          cumulative security fixes.  Use the Apache OpenOfficedownload page.If instead of a typical installation you use a custom-installation\n          option to change the location where Apache OpenOffice is installed,\n          use a location that has no spaces in its full-path name. Defenses and Work-Arounds If you are unable to update to 4.1.3, there are other precautions\n          that can be taken.  These precausions are also recommended as protection against other software that may have the vulnerability.Ensure that there are no programs installed at the top-level folder\n          (usually C:\\) where Windows is installed.  All are dangerous,\n          especially ones named \"Program\", whether \"Program.exe\" or some\n          other variation.If such programs are found, install or update to current\n          anti-virus/-malware software.  Perform a complete system scan.\n          The scan may provide for removal of programs where there should\n          not be any.  If that does not happen, it is necessary to remove\n          any Program.exe and others manually using administrator privilege.
