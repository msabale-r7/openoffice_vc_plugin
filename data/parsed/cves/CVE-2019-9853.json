  "description": "CVE-2019-9853 Apache OpenOffice Advisory CVE-2019-9853 Insufficient URL decoding flaw in categorizing macro location Fixed in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.7 Description OpenOffice documents can contain macros. The execution of those macros is controlled by the document security settings,\n      typically execution of macros are blocked by default. A URL decoding flaw existed in how the URLs to the macros within\n      the document were processed and categorized, resulting in the possibility to construct a document where macro execution\n      bypassed the security settings. The documents were correctly detected as containing macros, and prompted the user to\n      their existence within the documents, but macros within the document were subsequently not controlled by the security\n      settings allowing arbitrary macro execution.\n      This issue affects: OpenOffice 4.1.6 and older versions. Severity: Medium There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Thanks to the reporter for discovering this issue. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.6 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions may also be affected.
