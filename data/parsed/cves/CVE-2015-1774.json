  "description": "CVE-2015-1774 Apache OpenOffice Advisory Out-of-Bounds Write in HWP File Filter Version 2.0Announced April 27, 2015Updated October 28, 2015 A vulnerability in OpenOffice's HWP filter allows attackers to craft\n        malicious documents that cause denial of service (memory\n        corruption and application crash) and possible execution of arbitrary\n        code. Severity: Important Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions AffectedAll Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.1 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected. Mitigation Update to Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 or a later version. This mitigation drops Apache OpenOffice support for documents\n        created in \"Hangul Word Processor\" format.  The filter is not\n        installed; it will not be used if present. Workarounds and Document Migration Users of older HWP-format documents that are already trusted should\n        convert those documents to other formats before removing the filter\n        or upgrading to Apache OpenOffice version 4.1.2. Apache OpenOffice users who do not upgrade can remove the\n        problematic filter themselves.  The filter is in the \"program\"\n        folder of their OpenOffice installation.  OnWindowsthe filter is named \"hwp.dll\", onMac OS Xit is named\n        \"libhwp.dylib\" and onLinuxit is named \"libhwp.so\".\n        Alternatively the filter can be renamed to anything else (e.g.\n        \"hwp_renamed.dll\") to disable its use.
