  "description": "CVE-2022-37401 Apache OpenOffice Advisory Weak Master Keys Fixed in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.13 Description Apache OpenOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user's configuration\n     database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in\n     OpenOffice existed where master key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its entropy from 128 to\n     43 bits making the stored passwords vulnerable to a brute force attack if an attacker has access to the\n     users stored config. Severity: Moderate There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Thanks to the reporter for discovering this issue. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.12 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions may also be affected.
