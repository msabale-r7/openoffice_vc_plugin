Once these files are imported into a\n        maliciously-crafted document, the data can be silently hidden\n        in the document and possibly exported to an external party\n        without being observed. Severity: Important There are no known exploits of this vulnerabilty.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation Versions Affected All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.1 and older are affected.OpenOffice.org versions are also affected. Related:CVE-2014-3575andCVE-2012-0037 Mitigation Apache OpenOffice users are urged to download and install\n        Apache OpenOffice version 4.1.2 or later. Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 mitigates this vulnerability by ignoring\n        in-document settings that over-ride default behavior when accessing\n        data beyond the document itself.  The automatic default behavior\n        is changed to make such access evident to the user, who must then\n        approve the access. Nature of Attack This vulnerability requires an exquisitely crafted attack to\n        locate targeted files, silently retrieve them, and then deliver\n        their data in a manner that escapes notice.  Knowledge of the\n        user's system and specific configuration is generally required. Precautions  In addition to keeping Apache OpenOffice updated, users can reduce\n        the threat of this kind of data access from ODF\n        documents.  Keep documents and sensitive materials separate from\n        common, predictable locations, including on networks.  Require\n        additional access permissions for access to sensitive materials\n        even when operating under the user's normal account.
