  "description": "CVE-2023-47804 Apache OpenOffice Advisory Macro URL arbitrary script execution Fixed in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.15 Description Apache OpenOffice documents can contain links that call internal macros with arbitrary\n     arguments. Several URI Schemes are defined for this purpose. Links can be activated by\n     clicks, or by automatic document events. The execution of such links must be subject to\n     user approval. In the affected versions of Apache OpenOffice, approval for certain links\n     is not requested; when activated, such links could therefore result in arbitrary script\n     execution. This is a corner case of2022-47502. Severity: Moderate There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.A proof-of-concept demonstration exists. Thanks to the reporter for discovering this issue.
